# pomodoro 
**A personal project**

An Arduino implementation of a [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique "pomodoro") timer, written for the _Arduino Uno Rev3_.

---
### *TODO* : 
- [X] Fine tune the countdown interval
- [X] Implement EEPROM use for storing settings

---
### *Notes*:
> Countdown is accurate enough but making use of the ATmega328 inner timer would be a more reliable solution.
