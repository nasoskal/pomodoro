# pomodoro 
An Arduino implementation of a pomodoro timer

Written for the _Arduino Uno Rev3_

---
### *TODO*: 
- [X] Fine tune the countdown interval
- [X] Implement EEPROM use for storing settings

---
### *Notes*:
> Countdown is accurate enough but making use of the ATmega328 inner timer would be a more reliable solution.
